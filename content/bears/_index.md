Bears are stocky carnivores, omnivores, and sometimes even herbivores with a super bad rep thanks to well-documented cases of them wandering into populated areas and attacking, but in their own habitats they’re rather cute, solitary animals.
As Wilderness ambassadors, bears are a barometer for the health of  forests and ecosystems. If bear populations are thriving, it’s more than likely their natural surroundings are, too.

**If you like bears, consider donating to a wildlife charity of your choice!**
